This is the place where I occasionally share my notes and thoughts about
politics, life, my tiny computers, etc. The idea of starting my own websites is
inspired Luke Smith, and you should definitely check out his [website](
https://lukesmith.xyz/ ).

I'm a native Chinese (Simplified) speaker, so the site may contain contents
written in my mother tongue. And plz forgive any shortcomings and mistakes on
this website.

Thx for stopping by anyway.
